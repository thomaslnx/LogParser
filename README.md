This project aims to evaluate my skills as a full-stack software engineer for a hiring company process.

# Project Goal

This project aims to demonstrate my programming skills for a company hiring process. For this code challenge was asked to me to implement a file parser to read this [log](https://gist.github.com/cloudwalk-tests/be1b636e58abff14088c8b5309f575d8) file, extract some data, arrange and group them in information groups about kills, kills by means, kills caused by <world> and some others.


## Project Tech Stack

In this project, I used the following tech stacks as were asked to me for purpose to achieve this code challenge goal. Listed below:

- NodeJS;
- Typescript;
- Regular Expressions - REGEX (not were asked indeed, but was the best way to do this file parsing);
- Node Streams (ReadStream, WriteStream, Transform Stream);
